{"id":"9","menu_name":"Sweet Chilli Chicken Big","price":"5200","description":"I place the order at Domino's at 1801 Valley View Drive at 9:10 p.m. Saturday night. I use the tracker to see when when the delivery would be. I spoke with ** the manager a little after 10:30 wondering where my order was. ** tells me that they are two hours behind and so I asked if I wanted a refund would it go directly back to my card and ** informed me that it would be a few business days, so I decided to go ahead and wait for that order because it was my last 20$ but I asked ** would it still be fresh he told me that they would remake it so I said okay. I have no choice but to wait. I also asked ** if it would be here before 12:00 and he said it should be. No apology. He just hung up... Okay.!!"}
