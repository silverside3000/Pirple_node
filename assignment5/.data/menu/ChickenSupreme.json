{"id":"4","menu_name":"Chicken Supreme","price":"3500","description":"My Sweetheart & I are very pleased with the quality of the service & excellent Pizzas from the \"Domino's\" located on Central Ave & Thomas rd. here in Phoenix AZ! We ordered 2 large Pizzas from them on 10/21/2020 using my mobile phone, order #1001, and they got EVERYTHING RIGHT! (I rarely make reviews & only when a business is extraordinarily outstanding one way or the other) Not only did they get our order Exactly as requested; Double Pepperoni, Double Cheese, Double Bold & Spicy Sauce on Garlicky Buttery crust along with a Double 'Everything' Hawaiian that were Both Far Better than anything we've gotten ANYwhere since the 'Pandemic Crises' started. FOR HALF THE PRICE! Thank You from Dave & Holly."}
