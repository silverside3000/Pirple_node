{"id":"3","menu_name":"Tikka Chicken","price":"1800","description":"After an hour passed and refused cold uncooked all the way pizza the manager used my credit card 5 times for online google purchases. My bank locks my card and I have place fraud charges on my card. He was the only one with my card information and I know he is the one that did this. The bank will be investigating. If you read the reviews on this location there is a problem and your information could be used after it is stolen for his personal gain. I pissed him off and this is how he repaid me. Do not give your credit card information to this location."}
