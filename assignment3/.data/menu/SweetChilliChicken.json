{"id":"5","menu_name":"Sweet Chilli Chicken","price":"3800","description":"I ordered a 12inch pizza and a pasta bowl. I found a long black piece of hair in my mouth and another hair attached to another slice of pizza. I could not eat the pasta bowl due to the thought of finding another hair. I have been a rewards member with Domino's always giving the drivers the max tip of 20%. To this date I have not received my refund and I am still having stomach pains."}
